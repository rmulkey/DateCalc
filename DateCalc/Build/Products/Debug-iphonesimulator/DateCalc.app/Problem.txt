You are tasked with calculating the number of full
days elapsed in between start and end dates. The
first and the last day are considered partial days and
never counted. Following this logic, an experiment
that has run from 1972-11-07 to 1972-11-08 should
return 0, because there are no fully elapsed days
contained in between those dates, and 2000-01-01
to 2000-01-03 should return 1. The solution needs to
cater for all valid dates between 1901-01-01 and
2999-12-31.

Implement a command line based system with at
least one way of providing input and output on the
terminal. Although it should obvious, make sure the
solution compiles and works. Although any dates
specified within the valid date range listed above
should work, here are a few test cases to validate the
output of your program.

TEST CASES

1. 1983-06-02 – 1983-06-22: 19 days

2. 1984-07-04 – 1984-12-25: 173 days

3. 1989-01-03 – 1983-08-03: 1979 days

HINTS

1. We really do want to know how you did it. If
you’re tempted using a search engine to find a
solution, please be aware we know how to use
search engines too.

2. Less code is more - create a concise, however a
complete solution.

3. If it looks like it’s going to take significantly
longer than a few days to complete, it may be a
good time to reconsider your approach.

4. We do want you to succeed, so help us
understand why you make design or
programming choices – it will vastly improve the
solution.

5. Last but not least: there is no perfect
implementation, so don’t try to build one.
